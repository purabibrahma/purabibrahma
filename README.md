As for my education, I have a master’s in business administration and a bachelor’s in mathematics with Statistics and Economics. I especially love creating meaningful Dashboards in Power BI, Excel and have expertise in data extraction, transformation and loading using DAX. I am an expert in analyzing complex data and in report writing using Python programing and SQL queries to identify trends and patterns.
